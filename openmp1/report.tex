\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The "Hello world!" lines are interleaved because the statements in the first block are executed in parallel. This means that both threads will simultaneously execute the \texttt{printf("Hello ");} statement so you see that appearing twice. They will then execute the \texttt{printf("world!\textbackslash n");} statements in parallel which means that this is printed twice in a row. Because it happens in parallel the lines will be interleaved. We were not able to reproduce this interleaved effect on our own systems.
	
	The line "Have a nice day!" is not interleaved because only a single printf statement is executed in parallel, this simply comes down to executing this statement twice.
